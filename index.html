            This website was created with love, as part of the POSC103: World Politics course. As a Computer Science
            student with a passion for design and 3D modeling, I've built this site to reflect the theme of my own room.
            This is special, as I wanted to illustrate how world politics and global events shape the daily lives of
            individuals like myself. This highlights the importance of having a deep understanding of current affairs
            in today's complex, dynamic, and often chaotic world.

            My fascination with global affairs stems from my time in New York, where I worked at a tech startup
            positioned at the intersection of AI and public policy. Being there allowed me to witness firsthand how
            U.S. policy directly influences the global political landscape. I enrolled in this course to gain deeper
            insights into these international dynamics and to better understand the forces that move our world.

              <div class="entry-divider-inline"></div>
              <p class="entry-body">As a child, I used to play pretend with my soft toys at home with my brother. As the
                self-appointed king, I quickly learned that sharing too much about my "kingdom" invited unwanted advice
                from my brother. I was fearful of offending him, so I had to figure out how to tell him off nicely while
                protecting my sovereignty.
                Looking back, that living room floor was a perfect microcosm of modern international relations. In our
                hyper-connected world, transparency is the currency of cooperation, but it comes at a steep price:
                vulnerability. The more a nation shares, the more it invites external interference. After watching Black
                Panther and The Diplomat, I find that true sovereignty is increasingly difficult to maintain when the
                walls of the "kingdom" become glass, leaving us—much like my younger self—struggling to govern without
                someone else trying to move the stuffed animals.

              <div class="entry-divider-inline"></div>
              <p class="entry-body">Greater information transparency invites external actors to judge the state’s
                performance and influence the state of affairs of a sovereign state, reducing the sovereignty of a
                country. Information transparency does not necessarily mean that the “truth is out of the bag” , it just
                means that the state is judged by two actors: internally by its people and externally by the rest of
                the world. For example, in Black Panther, Tchalla is judged internally by his people as their king and
                externally by the UN and the rest of the world as the leader of a poor third world country. Similarly,
                in The Diplomat, with greater interconnectedness within states, Kate was sent as an external and foreign
                diplomat to handle the crisis between UK and Iran, evidently interfering in the affairs of a sovereign
                state. These narratives highlight a modern paradox: transparency is both a bridge and a breach. By
                getting the world to look behind the curtain, a country has to trade autonomy to be included in the
                global world. </p>

              <p class="entry-body">Ultimately as the lines between internal policy and external scrutiny continue to
                blur, sovereignty is no longer defined by total control, but by how skilfully a leader navigates the
                dual judgment of their own citizens and the global gallery. Whether it’s a fictional king in Wakanda or
                a diplomat in a real-world crisis, the lesson remains the same: in an interconnected world, sovereignty
                is becoming less and less important. And as ironic as it sounds, diplomacy – a convincing, elaborate
                performance by governments - is what keeps leaders navigating this interconnected, complicated game of
                cards today. </p>

                <p class="entry-body">I couldn’t help but notice how The Interview (2014) and Joint Security Area
                  (2000), both referenced North Korea. Despite being set 14 years apart and filmed in different
                  countries, both showed the same stereotype of North Korea – a notorious, highly-monitored
                  dictatorship with fearful and angry Koreans who will take revenge against US and Western ideology at
                  any time. Yet both shows showed a different reality from the stereotype – North Koreans are happy
                  there, have the capacity to put differences aside to have a good time with Americans and South
                  Koreans. This gave me a different point of view – we are all humans, yet the discrepancies highlight
                  how the media creates and exploits certain stereotypes of people to advance security interests,
                  which may not always be true.

                <p class="entry-body">For this section, I wanted a TV with this cartoon to represent this section. The
                  room represents the sovereign state we live in, and the TV represents the media stereotypes that are
                  presented to us. In both films, the media accurately represents the traditional beliefs of North
                  Korea, but what touched me the most was how all North Koreans, from the supreme leader to the
                  commoner, had the innate capacity to connect with their perceived “enemies” – both the United States
                  and South Korea to forge and cultivate strong relations. Yet, they always had to suppress it, as the
                  system, built on the fears of security, will eliminate them if they showed sympathy for their
                  enemies. </p>

              <p class="entry-body">This left me with the following thoughts:
              <ul class="entry-body">
                <li>Security as a tool for cohesion. Security is often a social construct utilized by those in power
                  to
                  maintain state relevance. If humans are innately tribal, the "need" for security becomes the glue
                  that
                  binds a community. In the absence of an active threat, "enemies" are often manufactured to justify
                  the
                  state's role as a protector.</li>
                <li>Borders serve as the physical manifestation of the security narrative. They don’t just mark
                  territory. With a clear divide between “me” and “them”, making the media’s caricatures of the
                  “other”
                  more believable.</li>
                <li>Media as a Force Multiplier: When media amplify security concerns, they amplify primal fears,
                  creating a feedback loop where the populace accepts suppression and state control in exchange for
                  the
                  illusion of safety from a stereotyped enemy.</li>

              <p class="entry-body">Ultimately, The Interview and JSA reveal a similar paradox: while individuals
                possess an innate desire for cross-border connection, the structures of sovereignty often depend on
                the suppression of that very empathy. In my 3D room, the TV serves as a constant flicker of
                'security-driven' narratives that keep us isolated within our own walls. If we recognize that these
                'enemies' are often constructs designed to maintain state cohesion, we begin to see the borders not as
                shields, but as barriers to a more authentic global community. Security should protect people, not
                just the systems that govern them.
                <br>
                Are the boundaries we respect protecting us, or are they simply keeping us from a connection that the
                system fears?
